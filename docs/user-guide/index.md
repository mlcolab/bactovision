# User Guide

This section provides comprehensive documentation on how to use BactoVision for annotating and analyzing bacterial growth images.

## Overview

BactoVision is designed with a focus on usability and flexibility. It provides both automatic and manual annotation capabilities, allowing researchers to quickly process large numbers of images while maintaining the ability to make fine-grained adjustments when needed.

The widget interface is divided into several functional areas:

1. **Preprocessing Controls** - Tools for enhancing image quality before annotation
2. **Grid Controls** - Options for configuring the analysis grid
3. **Manual Annotation Tools** - Brushes and eraser tools for direct annotation
4. **Automatic Annotation** - Algorithms for automated detection of bacterial colonies
5. **Canvas** - The main viewing and interaction area

## Basic Workflow

A typical workflow using BactoVision follows these steps:

1. **Load an image** - Create a BactoWidget with your bacterial growth image
2. **Adjust the grid** - Set up the grid to match your experimental design
3. **Preprocess the image** - Enhance contrast and other properties if needed
4. **Annotate** - Use automatic methods and refine with manual tools
5. **Extract data** - Get quantitative measurements from your annotations
